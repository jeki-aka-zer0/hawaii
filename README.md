Pet project of Evgeniy Zhukov

To init the project run `make init`. Because of the database image delay,
you have to wait until it is up and then run `make api-migrations`.

To test backend API you can use `api/src/Infrastructure/UI/Web/EAV/request.http` client.

The frontend is available at the http://localhost:3001.
